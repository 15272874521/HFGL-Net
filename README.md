# HFGL-Net:Laplacian-Based Explicit High-Frequency Component Guidance for a Multi-Scale Non-local Channel Attention Network in Remote Sensing Object Detection
In this paper, we propose a Laplacian-Based Explicit High-Frequency Component Guidance for a Multi-Scale Non-local Channel Attention Network(HFGL-Net).Specifically, a high-frequency decomposition of the image using the Laplacian pyramid and the introduction of a high-frequency component enhancement model (HCEM) explicitly capture the high-frequency information of the image, providing explicit high-frequency guidance to the network and thus enhancing the network’s detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-Scale Non-local Channel Attention Mechanism (MS-GLCA), which combines multi-scale and non-local perception mechanisms, adaptively fuses features at different scales, enhances the network’s ability to integrate local features with global dependencies, and more effectively assigns feature weights to the detection network.
